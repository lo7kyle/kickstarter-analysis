# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is a playwright who started a Kickstarter to fund her play _Fever_. Louise in this scenario came close to reaching her fundraising goal of **$10,000** in a short amount of time. There were no specific dates given, but from the background we can assume that she failed at funding her play before the end of her campaign. Initially throughout the module I assumed that we would collect, analyze, and present our data to Louise before her campaign; however, given my analysis of the data set I can understand why Louise came close to her fundraising goal, but fell short.   

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to use the various tools available in excel to do some analysis of a large dataset from Kickstarter. I as a Data Analyst had to comb through the data and visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch date and their funding goals to explain why Louise’s play _Fever_ might have failed. The goal of this challenge was not to prove why the Kickstarter failed, but to help me develop an eye for possible trends and to make meaning of the data presented.   
## Analysis and Challenges
There were 2 main analyses that I looked at that might have helped with Louise’s play. I looked at **outcomes based on launch date** and **outcomes based on goals**. These two analyses will not and cannot tell the whole story, but they do give an insight of possibilities of outcomes. I have plotted and graphed both analyses in hope to finding a clearer picture between the two relations. My initial analysis was to compare how successful Theater/plays Kickstarters were in comparison to other categories. Below is a bar graph of the outcomes of funding for different Major (Parent) categories.

Just from the plot alone we can see that Theater has the greatest number of campaigns and holds the most successful outcomes of the categories. We can already draw the conclusion that it was not due to the category of the Kickstarter that made the campaign fail. These analyses were not as cut and dry but also came with many challenges. One of the challenges I faced during the analysis was understanding how to determine an outlier. I am still learning on when to include an outlier in my analysis or when to exclude an outlier. Another challenge I faced was the breadth of the data set and determining if the relations I drew from the trend were accurate. I will elaborate later in my analysis on the relationships I drew based on the trend. Another challenge worth mentioning is also the limitations of the dataset. Every dataset cannot have every nuance and it is up to us to determine what we can do with what we are given. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
One of the relationships that I never thought to have looked at was outcomes based on launch date. It was not until I started analyzing the data with the launch date in mind where I started to understand the possibility of how the month may affect the success rate. From my analysis we see that in the Month of May we have our greatest success rate and in December we have our lowest.

Working in tech I understood why certain companies had specific launch dates, so relating my knowledge of the current tech industry and the Kickstarter success rate I can see a clearer picture. From the graph we see that May had the highest success rate which is the start of Q2. This can be as a result of most Q1 earnings being positive a good amount of time (at least in the tech industry). May is also in spring where a lot of new tech are speculated and teased by a lot of companies and the release date is in the fall (September-November). With teases of products, you can build hype around a certain product. Similarly, you can build hype around your play for a release date in the Summer or possibly Winter. This hype is almost a free advertisement for your Kickstarter. We know that near the end of the year people are more likely to have time off with their family so it is more likely that they will go watch your play in the Fall/Wintertime. Similarly, we can relate the decline in success rate in December with the same idea. Apple has their Flagship event for their iPhones in September/October on purpose so that by the holidays they can have their sales increased. Circling back to the point I made in the beginning, in spring there aren’t that many holidays where people would spend their money so donating to a Kickstarter will be higher than during the holidays when people are spending money on iPhones. Similarly, we can see that there are less theater Kickstarters during the time of Fall to Winter probably because this is when the shows are playing for the holidays.

Just by looking at the trend alone can help you determine the most successful launch date, but upon further analysis of external factors such as holidays and other sectors of the economy we can determine the most important question, why. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
One of the most important aspect of any business regardless of category is budgeting. Where will you get your all your funding? Where will the funding go? What does your business need to succeed? These are all questions you need to ask yourself before starting a Kickstarter. One relation that I observed from my analysis is the outcome rate based on goals. A quick disclaimer when doing this analysis is that for Kickstarter campaigns to be successful, they need to hit their campaign’s funding goal or else it’s a failure and the donations are sent back to the patrons. It is an all or nothing approach for Kickstarter. With this information alone we can determine that any goals with a large funding goal will have a greater failure than success.

From the line graph we see that the highest success rate is funding from less than or equals to $5000. In addition, there is a steady decline of success rate from $5000 to $25000. Taking a further look, we see that the graph then slopes positively again after $25000 to $40000 to roughly around a 60% success rate. This can be due to outliers and or external factors that we do not account for that I will address in the challenges and difficulties encountered section. From the Descriptive Statistics sheet in my excel submitted we can see that the Mean successful lies within the 3rd Quartile, so the data follows similar distribution in each subset. We also see that the standard deviation ($7000) is higher than the mean ($5000), we can assume that any goal lower than the mean is closer to the median ($3000). Since the standard deviation is also higher than twice the IQR for success rate and three times as high for failure, we know that there are very large values that can possibly be outliers in our analysis. This also tells us that there is a good chance that most Kickstarters with really high goals fail.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
When trying to make a fair analysis there were many difficulties and challenges encountered. One of the challenges I mentioned earlier was determining how to treat an outlier. I was not sure if the outlier of successful High Goals in my analyses proved that there is a certain threshold where the success rate will increase. This is shown when there was a negative slope up to 25000 then a positive slope from 25000 to 40000. Looking back that this data point I can see that there were little data in these ranges and that could have skewed the data. Another challenged was understanding the reasons behind the set goal amounts. My question is, if there are more successful Lower Goal campaigns, why can’t Louise have multiple campaigns with a lower goal amount instead of her single $10000 campaign. This question can be a possible solution for someone who wants to have a higher goal campaign to host multiple Kickstarters. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 
Two conclusions from the outcomes based on launch date is that:
1.	Most successful Kickstarters have a May Launch date that probably correlates to the hype and teases of Plays with showings for the Holidays. This can also translate to a longer campaign with a possibility of more time to prep for the Holiday season.
2.	The worst time to launch a campaign is during the Holidays where people might be spending more money but donating less. This can be a result of people trying to close out their end of year expenses and spending more money on gifts for the holidays.     
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 
I can conclude that higher goals have a higher fail rate. This can be in part due to Kickstarters policy where a campaign needs to hit their campaign goals to get the funding. Another factor can also be with a higher goal and few pledges, most people will be less reluctant to pledge because the Kickstarter might not succeed anyways.  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
 
There are many limitations to how much objective data a dataset can give. One of the limitations can be how much of a Play’s budget needs to come from Kickstarter’s funding. This might be the reason why there are some plays that require a higher goal and there are some that requires much less. From our analysis we already see how the Goal amount determines the success rate of these Kickstarter. There might be a play that already has an alternative source of funding so the Kickstarter amount can be smaller. Another limitation is the popularity of the Kickstarter. I have personally pledged to a popular Kickstarter game that reached its goal in less than the Campaign length because it was an extremely popular, well-known title. This subjective and intrinsic value of popularity plays a huge role in a success rate that objective data can’t represent. Lastly, there are usually Kickstarter backers reward that is not listed. If there is another column that lists the reward amount i.e. 2 free tickets valued at $30, we can see if the rewards play a role in success rate and popularity.   

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 
Other possible tables and graph that can be drawn from our current data set can be the length of each campaign. This plays a role in how successful a Kickstarter is because if the Goal is larger, we can calculate the average campaign length per dollar pledged to find a more feasible goal. Another table that I worked on in my analysis that I did not graph was the number of backers per pledge amount. Although calculating this in a separate column, I never graphed it as a relationship to success rate. This can easily tell you the audience of the Kickstarter from big corporation donations to smaller online donors. This can help you to advertise to the market you are lacking or double down in the market you are most successful.
